<h2>My Favorite color</h2>

<p>I am a basic boi and my favorite color is blue, I don't know why but it just something that just became my favorite color.</p>

<h2>One of my favorite artworks</h2>

<p>One of my favorite artworks was the dragon ball legends animation that took the team 4 years to make. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JKLM45aIik">Click me to watch it.</a> This animation was just so good and the fact that they did all of it for free just blows my mind. The animation is 9ish minutes long please give it a look at.</p>

<h2>What I look forward to</h2>

<p>I am looking forward to regaining my coding skills back, it's been a while since I coded anything. Hopefuly I am not as rusty as I think I am. </p>

<h2>What I don't look fowrard to</h2>

<p>I do not look forward to is the long hours of coding that is going to happen. I don't really like staying on one thing for too long, but I will suck it up to do what I have to do.</p>

<h2>A recommendation from me</h2>

<p>I am not going to be that person and says watch One Piece, (Good series tho) but I will recommend you to watch Wakfu. Wakfu is a french animated show about a boy with powers trying to find his family, I wont spoil the rest of the show incase someone wants to watch it. What I will say is that to watch it subbed, the engish dub is not that great in the earlier seasons. The dub does get better but it's buts if you watch it subbed. Plus it's also on Netflix</p>
